Train a Naïve Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis of Amazon users’ reviews for refurbished iPhone 7. You are given:
1)	Training set that consists of 6 positive reviews and 4 negative reviews (please see below)
2)	A set of 4 keywords: Great, Happy, Bad, Return. Those keywords should define 4-dimensional feature vectors for reviews (bag-of-words)
